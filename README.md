# L293D Samples in Arduino

Assorted samples on how use **L293D** motor drivers in `Arduino`.

* `L293D_DCMotorDirection` - demonstrate changing direction of two DC motors connected to **L293D**.
* `L293D_DCMotorDirection_BiPolar +ULN2003` - controlling direction of DC motor added **ULN2003** to save more `I/O` pins of Arduino.
* `L293D_DCMotorDirection_BiPolar +Transistor` - controlling direction of DC motor added single **NPN Transistor** to save more `I/O` pins of Arduino.
